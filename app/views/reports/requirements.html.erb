<h5>Sweety</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Sweety is a simple web application which enables a user to input and track blood glucose readings and view reports on those readings.
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Users</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The typical user of the Sweety application is a diabetes patient who is checking his or her blood glucose levels several times a day. These individuals are looking for a method to keep track of their readings on a daily basis and examine monthly trends.
	</li>
	<li>In the future, doctors may also have access to this application to review patient entered blood glucose levels and review the same daily and monthly data.
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Functionality</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The applications functionality relates to two core features: entering blood glucose level readings and view reports on those readings.
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Data Entry</h5>
<ul>
	<li>A user should be able to enter data up to four times per day. Data is entered as a single integer value representing blood glucose levels (measured in mg/dl). Data should be validated to ensure that a level is 
	included in the entry and that there are no more than 4 entries on a given day.
	</li>
	<li>Data entry -- 4x a day </li>
</ul>

<h5>Reports</h5>
<ul>
	<li>A user should be able to view reports of their data. There are three kinds of reports: daily report, month to date report, and monthly report. With a date selector, the user should be able to select the end date of the report. For daily reports, data will represent entries from that day. For month to date reports, data will start on the first 
	of the month for the selected date and end on that date. For monthly reports, reports will include data spanning the month the previous monthly period.</li>
	<li>Reports should include three data points: a maximum reading from the time period, a minimum reading for the time period, and an average of the whole data set for the period. </li>
</ul>
